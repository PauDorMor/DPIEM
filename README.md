# DPIEM
Prototype program for the identification of electromedical equipment. It is based on the list of *medical equipment* included in *NOM-016-SSA3-2012* (Official Mexican Standard establishing the minimum characteristics of infrastructure and equipment for hospitals and specialized medical care clinics), specifically the equipment listed in Appendix H, which is the EM of the surgical unit. Complementary equipment was added, such as infusion pumps (*IP*), *C-arms*, defibrillators (*def*), electrocardiographs (*ECG*), ethylene oxide (*EtO*) sterilizers, ultrasound (*US*), mechanical ventilators (*MV*), and portable X-ray machines (*X-Ray*). The database used consists of 970 images of these medical devices, most of which are from vital signs monitors (*VSM*), followed by IP. This was done by collecting seven databases of medical device images, from which the most representative images for the model and intended use were retrieved.
